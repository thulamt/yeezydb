      "body": "Searching for creative freedom, Kanye West left Nike for adidas in late 2013. The minute the adidas x Kanye West partnership was announced, anticipation began to build. In true Yeezy fashion, Kanye first wore the 750 Yeezy Boost to the Grammy`s. The first colorway of the adidas Yeezy Boost 750, which is technically Brown/Carbon White/Light Brown but most commonly referred to as grey, released over NBA All-Star Weekend that took place in New York City that year. To make things fair and safe for customers, adidas launched an app to handle reservations. If you were lucky enough to get through on the app you were able to pick up your Yeezy Boosts from a nearby retailer. Kanye and adidas went above and beyond with extra personnel to make sure that every person who obtained a pair was able to pick up their pair safely. The Yeezy 750 is a bold design featuring a high cut and zippered ankle, and because of it, many sneakerheads scoffed at the shoe. The design is one of the first shoes from adidas to feature almost no visual branding. Even the Three Stripes are tucked away underneath the midfoot strap. To help launch the shoe, Kanye West and adidas held a fashion show in NYC for Kanyeâ€™s Yeezy Season 1 and live streamed the show to 42 movie theaters across the globe. To make the launch even more special for Yeezy fans, Kanye West surprised some of those who purchased the adidas Yeezy Boost by handing them their new Yeezy sneakers in person.\n-StockX",
